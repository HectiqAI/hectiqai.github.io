In 2013-2014, right after the first splash made by AlexNet, we could already feel the excitement, but DL was still an academic affair.

It\u2019s true that the main job of a DS is not always to put software directly in production, but in years of doing this I never encountered a successful machine learning or data science  project without having the DS themself taking care of a bunch of the engineering aspects.
