    summary: "Hectiq.AI completes an exciting collaboration with Vox Media. We have developed an Ai model to help Vox Media better understand their audience. The challenge was tough as the model needed to be privacy-friendly, crazy fast, and highly effective. In this post, we explain what motivated this project, namely developing an alternative to 'creepy' third-party data, and we discuss how we achieved the task by using state-of-the-art deep learning models.
